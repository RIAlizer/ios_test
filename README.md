* do not use any open source frameworks, only use native frameworks available
* For Json Managment you can use JSON Parser 
* push the code on your Github account and make a pull request to YakimbiICT/ios_test
* **IF YOU CAN'T USE A PUBLIC REPO ON GITHUB, USE BITCUCKET [[ https://bitbucket.org/ ]] AND SET UP A PRIVATE REPO**

## Bonus points
* Add branches for both ARC and non-ARC implementations.
* Add unit or/and functional tests

## DEVELOPMENT

### Compatibility
* iOs Deplyment Target iOS 5.0
* iPhone/ iPad
* works on ARC and non-ARC enviroment (more info @ Utils/Define.h )



### Dependencies
Dependencies are managed using **CocoaPods** (www.cocoapods.org).  
In order to compile sources you must open **YakimbiIosTest.xcworkspace**.  
All these libraries are essential for advanced iOS development.

* **InAppSettingsKit** is an open source solution to to easily add in-app settings to your iPhone apps.  
 *pod 'InAppSettingsKit', '~> 1.0' https://github.com/futuretap/InAppSettingsKit*

* **DCIntrospect** is small set of tools for iOS that aid in debugging user interfaces built with UIKit. It's especially useful for UI layouts that are dynamically created or can change during runtime, or for tuning performance by finding non-opaque views or views that are re-drawing unnecessarily. It's designed for use in the iPhone simulator, but can also be used on a device.  
*pod 'DCIntrospect', '~> 0.0.2' https://github.com/domesticcatsoftware/DCIntrospect*

* **ISO8601DateFormatter** is a standard Date formatter  
 *pod 'ISO8601DateFormatter', '~> 0.6' https://bitbucket.org/boredzo/iso-8601-parser-unparser/*
